# Om mig

As a passionate student in both engineering and business, I am pursuing a dual academic path with a Bachelor’s in Mechatronics at Chalmers University of Technology and a Bachelor’s in Business Administration at the School of Business, Economics, and Law in Gothenburg. I am driven by a desire to merge technical expertise with strategic business insights to solve complex challenges and create real-world impact.

As the President & CEO of HandelsFöretagen, the largest student-led business group in the Nordics, where I lead a dynamic organization consisting of seven companies and over 160 ambitious colleagues. In this role, I am responsible for strategic development, cross-company collaboration, and long-term growth initiatives.

My background includes experience in management consulting, entrepreneurship, and leadership through military service and academic roles. I also have a longstanding passion for finance and the stock market, and remain an active member of Unga Aktiespararna and Chalmers Börssällskap.
