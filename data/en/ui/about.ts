    'I am a driven and high performing double degree student in engineering and business currently pursuing a BSc in Mechatronics at Chalmers University of Technology alongside a BSc in Business Administration at the School of Business, Economics and Law. My academic achievements have been recognized through multiple awards including the Adlerbert Scholarship which I received two years in a row.',
    'Alongside my studies I serve as President and CEO of HandelsFöretagen which is the largest student run business conglomerate in the Nordics. I lead an organization of over 180 students across seven companies. During my first quarter we delivered the strongest financial results in the history of the organization achieving revenue growth of 95 percent year over year. Leading this transformation has strengthened my ability to drive strategic growth and build high performing teams.',
    'Previously I worked as a Management Consultant at HandelsConsulting where I was quickly promoted due to strong performance. One of my key achievements was beating my three month sales target with 150 percent in my first five weeks. This effort led to me winning an internal sales competition and being awarded the company Medal of Honor for the core value Drive which is a quality that characterizes everything I do.',
    'I have broadened my technical background by founding startups like StuNote and CampusLyan. Building technical platforms from scratch has given me a deep understanding of software development. At my core I carry with me the experience from the Swedish Armed Forces where I learned the importance of resilience and teamwork in high pressure environments as a Group Leader.',
