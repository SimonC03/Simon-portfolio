      'During my first year at Chalmers, I met Simon. After many hours studying and discussing ideas, I can confidently say he stands out. Simon has a strong desire to help those around him, making him a valued friend and teammate in our study group. His drive to consistently do his best in every task is impressive. Simon starts tasks promptly and never gives up until the problem is solved, often using various problem-solving methods. Moreover, Simon is an excellent team player in group projects. This year at Chalmers, we collaborated on programming an air supply system for a building. Simon´s technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and clear communication were key to our project´s success. Simon not only contributes his knowledge but also offers strong support, creating a positive and productive working environment. I am confident that Simon will be a valuable asset to any team he joins.',
